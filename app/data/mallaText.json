  "question2": "So... it's a CMS?",
  "answer2": "Close. Malla is designed to make it easy to store any text from your website or mobile app: headings, intros, buttons, disclaimers... you get the idea.\nAnd since it doesn't focus on articles and pages and pictures like a CMS does, it's much simpler, and much faster than a typical CMS. Check out the video above to see how easy it is.",
